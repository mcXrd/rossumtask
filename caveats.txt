1) With username 'myUser123' and password 'secretSecret'  - trying to log via "https://api.elis.rossum.ai/v1/auth/login" - returns {'non_field_errors': ['Unable to log in with provided credentials.']}
    Also creating free trial account is kinda problematic for me since it does not accept @gmail.com and neither @protonmail.com domain .
    Because of that I decided to code whole solution blindfolded. But having account would help me quite a bit.
2) export-UK demo teplate-2021-03-08.xml vs converted_file.xml - has to have few inconsistencies - otherwise it does not make sense to me
        1) last item in converted_file.xml has Notes value - <Notes>Line item 2</Notes> but coresponding value in original is 'fre-ghti'
            I wonder if I am supposed to detect text which does not look like word or sentence and replace it with generic
            text in that case? Or is it just an error?
        2) <TotalAmount>2706.00</TotalAmount> <Amount>2595.76</Amount> - these are value inside <Payable></Payable> in converted_file.xml
            and it does not make sense to me. Value 2706.00 is not even present in original.xml at all.
            What makes most sense here (to me) is that we have "amount_total" and "amount_total_tax" in the original
            and that should correspond to "amount_total" + "amount_total_tax" = <TotalAmount>
            and "amount_total"= <Amount>

            But I am really just guessing here.

3) Downloading annotation just by annotation_id does not seem to be possible - https://api.elis.rossum.ai/docs/#export-annotations
    I thing this endpoint is most appropriate but it requires queue id - but document "Flask app for converting XMLs .pdf"
    only states the notion of id for annotation (123456) - or is that 123456 id meant for queue?



With all that being said - I tried to fill this space of uncertainity with most likely choices (e.g. I am
asking for both queue_id and annotation_id) - so project is
in the usable state - let me know if this is enough for you - or I can still adjust some things if you provide
me with some more clarification.

Last note - I dont provide
